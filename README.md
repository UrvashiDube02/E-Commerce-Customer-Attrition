In the vast world of marketing with a load of competition among retail stores, an e-commerce retail store 
is facing customer attrition. After a careful study considering all the factors, reasons, and possibilities of the 
churn, we are required to build a model to analyze the rate of decreasing customers, tackle the declining rate, 
as well introduce ways to attract new customers by providing possible solutions. </p>

**HOW DOES THE MARKET FUNCTION?**

<p align = "justify">
To put it simply, retail is indeed the distribution of products or services to individual customers. It is the final 
link in the supply chain, and it is responsible for dispersing finished goods to end-users. The items sold are 
not intended for resale or commercial use. Generally speaking, retail sales entails delivering single or small 
amounts of goods to customers. Goods are delivered directly to the buyer from a single place of purchase, 
such as a store.</p>
